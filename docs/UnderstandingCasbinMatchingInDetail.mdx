# Understanding how Casbin Works

In this post I will explain RBAC design and implementation using the [Casbin](https://casbin.org/) library. For a SaaS platform that deals with multiple Resource
Hierarchies, and roles that inherit permissions from higher levels Casbin is a performant alternative to consider.

## What is RBAC?

RBAC is a method of restricting access to resources based on the Roles that an individual holds. Let's look at Azure's
RBAC system in the next section to better understand how Hierarchical RBAC works, and then we can try to implement a system
which is similar.

## Understanding Azure's Hierarchical RBAC

![Azure Hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png)

There is a role called **Owner** for all resources in Azure, suppose if I have **Owner** role assigned to me at
subscription level, that means I am the **Owner** of all the resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have
**Owner** at resource group level, then I am the **Owner** of all the resources under that resource group.

This image shows that I have **Owner** access at Subscription level. ![Subscription Owner](/img/tutorial/subscription-owner.png)

When I check the IAM of a Resource Group under this Subscription, you can see I have inherited **Owner** access from the
Subscription.  ![RG Owner](/img/tutorial/rg-owner.png)

So this is how Azure's RBAC is hierarchical, most of the enterprise software use hierarchical RBAC because of the hierarchical
nature of the resource levels in this tutorial, we'll try to implement a similar system in this tutorial using Casbin.

## How Casbin Works?

Before the implementation we have to understand what is Casbin and how it works at a high level. This is required because
each RBAC system will differ based on the requirement. So understanding Casbin helps us to fine tune the model.

## What is ACL?

ACL is where users are mapped to actions and actions to resources.

### The model definition

Let's take a simple example **ACL** model

```toml
[request_definition]
r = sub, act, obj

[policy_definition]
p = sub, act, obj

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
```

1. The **request_definition** is the query template of the system. For example, a request `alice, write, data1` can be
read as `can subject alice do action write on object data1`.

2. The **policy_definition** is the assignment template of the system. For example, by creating a policy `alice, write, data1` you're
assigning permission to subject alice for doing action write on object data1.

3. The **policy_effect** defines the effect of the policy.

4. Given a request and set of policies, the **matchers** section matches the request with policy.

### Now let's test the model on Casbin editor

Open [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.

Paste the following in the Policy editor

```csv
p, alice, read, data1
p, bob, write, data2
```

and the following in the Request editor

```csv
alice, read, data1
```

Result will be

```
true
```

## What is RBAC?

In RBAC a user is assigned a role for a resource, a role can contain arbitrary actions. And the request checks if the user can do the action on
resource.

### The model definition

Let's take a simple example **RBAC** model

```toml
[request_definition]
r = sub, act, obj

[policy_definition]
p = sub, act, obj

[role_definition]
g = _, _
g2 = _, _

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && r.obj == p.obj
```

1. The **role_definition** is a graph relation builder which uses a Graph to compare the request object with the policy object.

### Now let's test the model on Casbin editor

Open [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.

Paste the following in the Policy editor

```csv
p, alice, reader, data1
p, bob, owner, data2

g, reader, read
g, owner, read
g, owner, write
```

and the following in the Request editor

```csv
alice, read, data1
alice, write, data1
bob, write, data2
bob, read, data2
bob, write, data1
```

Result will be

```
true
false
true
true
false
```

### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy and request matching

![rbac](/img/tutorial/rbac.png)

The **g - Role to action mapping** table has a Graph mapping the role to action mapping. This Graph can be coded as a list of
edges, as shown in the policy which is a common way of representing a Graph

```
g, reader, read
g, owner, read
g, owner, write
```

:::info
**p** indicates a normal policy which can be compared using **==** operator. **g** is a Graph based comparison function.
You can define multiple Graph comparators by adding a numerical suffix like **g, g2, g3, ...** and more.
:::

## What is Hierarchical RBAC?

In Hierarchical RBAC there are more than one type of resources and there is an inheritance relationship between the resource types,
for example subscription is one type and resourceGroup is another type, sub1 of type **Subscription** can contain multiple
resourceGroups rg1, rg2 of type **ResourceGroup**.

Similar to the resource hierarchy there will be two types of roles and actions. Subscription roles and actions, ResourceGroup roles and actions.
And there is a arbitrary relationship between the Subscription role and ResourceGroup role, for example consider a Subscription Role **sub-owner**,
this role is inherited by a ResourceGroup Role **rg-owner**, meaning if I am assigned **sub-owner** on Subscription **sub1**, then I automatically
also get **rg-owner** role on **rg1 and rg2**.

### The model definition

Let's take a simple example **Hierarchical RBAC** model

```toml
[request_definition]
r = sub, act, obj

[policy_definition]
p = sub, act, obj

[role_definition]
g = _, _
g2 = _, _

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && g2(p.obj, r.obj)
```

1. The **role_definition** is a graph relation builder which uses a Graph to compare the request object with the policy object.

### Now let's test the model on Casbin editor

Open [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the above model in the Model editor.

Paste the following in the Policy editor

```csv
p, alice, sub-reader, sub1
p, bob, rg-owner, rg2

// subscription role to subscription action mapping
g, sub-reader, sub-read
g, sub-owner, sub-read
g, sub-owner, sub-write

// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping
g, rg-reader, rg-read
g, rg-owner, rg-read
g, rg-owner, rg-write

// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping
g, sub-reader, rg-reader
g, sub-owner, rg-owner

// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping
g2, sub1, rg1
g2, sub2, rg2
```

and the following in the Request editor

```csv
alice, rg-read, rg1
```

Result will be

```
true
```

### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy and request matching

![hrbac](/img/tutorial/hrbac.png)

The **g - Role to (Action, Role) Mapping** table has a Graph mapping the role to action, role mapping. This Graph can be coded as a list of
edges, as shown in the policy which is a common way of representing a Graph

```

// subscription role to subscription action mapping
g, sub-reader, sub-read
g, sub-owner, sub-read
g, sub-owner, sub-write

// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping
g, rg-reader, rg-read
g, rg-owner, rg-read
g, rg-owner, rg-write

// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping
g, sub-reader, rg-reader
g, sub-owner, rg-owner
```

The **g2 - Sub to RG Mapping** table has a Graph mapping subscription to resourceGroup.

```
// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping
g2, sub1, rg1
g2, sub2, rg2
```

:::info
When a request is submitted to Casbin, this matching happens for all the policies, if at least one policy matches then the result of the
request is true, if no policy matches the request, then the result is false

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learnt how different authorization models work and how it can be modeled using Casbin. In the second part
of this tutorial we will implement this in a demo Spring Boot Application and secure the APIs using Casbin.
